# Call for contributions

We are soliciting contributions that are on topic for the workshop in one of
four forms (or any mixture thereof):

1. State-of-the-union speeches: Where is your favorite IoT
   standards-settings organization on the road to semantic/hypermedia
   interoperability, and what are its next steps?  What role could it
   play in the emerging IoT semantic interoperability ecosystem?

2. Research contributions:  What did you try?  What did you learn
   about the self-description properties of the devices and the
   modeling languages in use?  How can you translate between different
   approaches?  What are the semantic limitations that you
   encountered?  What can you say about what properties modeling
   languages and self-description formats should have?

3. Prototypes:  What did you build?  What did you learn from it?

4. Work proposals:  What should be done?  Can you give a roadmap of
   what analyses, experiments, prototypical artifacts should the
   community try next?

Some slots for #1 are already allocated, so please check
with <mailto:t2trg-chairs@irtf.org> to avoid duplication.

For all contributions, a short position paper is the preferred form of
input.  For a selected subset of these contributions, we will allocate
presentation and discussion time.

Don't let our request for a paper discourage you from proposing other
interesting forms of contributions.  If you have a great demo, or an
existing paper a discussion of which would help us forward, please do
suggest it.  (You can always write a few additional paragraphs for the
workshop so people can come prepared and understand how your work fits
in.)

# Important dates

For the state-of-the-union speeches (type #1 above), please discuss
your request with the chairs by May 31.

For the other types, please register your intent to submit a
